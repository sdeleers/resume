\section{experience}
\begin{twenty}
  \twentyitem
    {2014-2016}
    {Esloq}
    {Leuven, Belgium}
    {\textit{Co Founder}\\We built smartphone controlled door locks which were installed mainly at coworking spaces and B\&Bs. We decided to stop in 2016 because of insufficient traction. In my opinion this was mainly due to a lack of sales experience.}
  \twentyitem
    {2013-2014}
    {KU Leuven}
    {Leuven, Belgium}
    {\textit{Research Assistant}\\I helped develop a MOOC for a course on control theory. My task was to illustrate the course's concepts with clear examples and write both the front and back end of the MOOC.}
    \twentyitem
    {2012}
    {IPCOS}
    {Haasrode, Belgium}
    {\textit{Summer Intern}\\IPCOS uses mathematical models of chemical plants to control them with MPC. I automated the tuning of the parameters of these models which alleviated the work that needed to be done on-site by an engineer.}
